Version Control - Git Lecture Stanford

Version Control is IMPORTANT
- Example is google docs. Real time collaboration for rich text

Git
- Version control that tracks commits of files in a repository
- Stores old versions of files in hidden folders (.git) and auto manages them
- Tell git to track certain files and when to snapshot
- Use git to go back to old snapshots or parts of old snapshots
- You can use git to track who’s working on what and multiple people can work on stuff without competing

Git (why it’s better than google docs ts)
- Great at workin with code
- Checkpoints are manual instead of automatic
- No internet connection
- Multiple current version of a project

Git Workflows:
- Linear Flow
- Branching Flow
